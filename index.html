        <h1>Welcome to My Birthday Advice Page!</h1>
        <p>
            Birthdays are special moments, not just for celebration, but also for reflection. 
            This year, I wish to make it more meaningful by collecting advice from my loved ones. 
            Your words will stay with me forever and guide me on my journey ahead. ðŸ’¡
        </p>
        <p>
            Please share your best piece of advice for life, happiness, or success. 
            I'm excited to hear your thoughts and learn from your experiences!
        </p>
